= About ‗Corpse =

‗Corpse tells you the faction, online status, and other information about corpses you see.  That is, when you mouse over a corpse (after the player releases spirit), ‗Corpse automatically queries the server about who owns the body and automatically colors and fills out its tooltip like a regular living unit.

== How It Works ==
This mod is a spiritual successor to _!CorpseInfo,_ however it is significantly
faster and less prone to error because it uses the friends list rather than "`/who`"
queries.  Not only that, but it's always accurate about the target's faction,
and can see when enemies are online.

In battlegrounds, ‗Corpse uses the scoreboard data directly to instantly give
you class and faction information.

= Why Use ‗Corpse? =
It can help you decide if a corpse is worth resurrecting, because it shows online/offline status and `<AFK>` flags.  Wondering if a dead enemy is still online and worth camping?  This is your mod.  It has no configuration; just install it and mouse over some corpses.
